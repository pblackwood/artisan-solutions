            <h1>Solution Design & Architecture</h1>
            <p>
                My whole career has been about making sound engineering decisions. It's not about the newest or
                coolest
                technologies. It's about finding the solution you and your team can <em>actually deliver</em> in the
                time and budget you have.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's always a balancing act between feature set and simplicity, build vs buy, performance vs rich
                user experience. I am good at managing the interplay of different priorities.
            </p>
            <h1>Clean, Well-Tested Code</h1>
            <p>
                Your applications won't do much without code. To insure the very highest quality, embrace
                testing in all environments, from the developer's laptop to production.
                Automated unit tests are a given. You also need automated UI testing, end-to-end system integration
                testing, security vulnerability testing, and of course good old manual testing by subject matter
                experts.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can show you how to embed quality metrics into your team's process. Think continuous integration,
                code coverage, static code analysis, security vulnerability analysis and many more tools can be
                embedded into the SDLC with low impact and maximum benefit.
            </p>
            <h1>Team Leadership</h1>
            <p>
                I can lead teams from start to finish on complex projects. I have always gotten rave reviews on my
                project
                deliverables, tests, cloud deployments and team dynamics (aka we have fun while getting things
                done).
            </p>
            <p>
                I love mentoring and coaching newer developers and can also talk solution architecture with your
                most
                senior
                technologists.

                In my last FT role I was both a hands-on Lead Consultant and also a People Manager for 4-5 direct
                reports.
                So I'm familiar with HR management as well as project management and I enjoy both roles.
            </p>
            <h1>Communication</h1>
            <p>
                Communication is my superpower. I am equally comfortable talking about requirements with business
                leaders,
                UX/UI with product designers, technical trade-offs with engineers, and KPIs with management.
            </p>
            <h1>Consulting</h1>
            <p>
                Let me help you with your software development <em>process</em> as well as the <em>tasks</em>. I
                know
                what
                works and what doesn't. Contact me to collaborate on what this might mean in practice. All teams and
                projects
                are different but there are many commonalities.
            </p>
            <h1>How to Work with Me</h1>
            <p>
                I can consult directly with you on an hourly basis though my company, Artisan Solutions LLC. Contact
                me
                for current rates.
                Or if you would prefer, you can hire me to work on a specific idea on a project basis. Initial
                conversations are always free.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alternatively, you can partner with a software services firm and hire me a sub-contractor as I have
                done
                many
                times in the past. Check out my list of superb partners I have worked with below.
            </p>
            <p>
                I can also take on bigger projects and staff them with my own team. Let's talk!
